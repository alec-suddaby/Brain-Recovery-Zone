### Audio on buttons
Currently the audio on buttons is coming from the Button Array Script under the EventSystem. Each button needs to be manually added to this array. Moving forward it would be good to create a list of buttons in a scene that are tagged with 'button' or similar to add into the array

### Change scenes
Is done through a script that adds a top dropdown menu that adds each scene peristantly loaded in the correct order
